"""
acos-submit is a custom directive that behaves almost identically to the normal
submit directive. It is intended for exercises that are hosted outside the MOOC grader,
such as the ACOS server. The directive option url should define the URL path of
the exercise in the ACOS server. The URL domain is added automatically based on
the configuration value "acos_submit_base_url" (in conf.py). The acos-submit
directive also automatically uses the "ajax" flag of the submit directive.
